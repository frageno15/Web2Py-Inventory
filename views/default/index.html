<h1>Welcome to the Inventory System</h1>

<p>
This system is a work in progress.  It should be fairly complete in
the basic requirements.  At the moment Adding inventory, checking in
and out, browsing, and basic reports are done.  Next requirement will
be some permissions to allow anyone to search for items while limiting
who can check in out and out items as well as adding items.
</p>

<p>
To be decided, how to delete/remove items while keeping accountability.
